    We live in a world of breathtaking beauty, of fascinating mystery. And those mysteries only become more compelling as we unravel them.
    <br><br>
    In a universe of natural, mathematical laws, sentient beings arose who cared about that beauty and mystery.
    <br><br>
    Even if the world isn’t always fair — even if there is no God to help us — we have the power to help each other. Each generation can build better tools to change the world. Better ethical systems to guide us.
    <br><br>
    We stand atop the shoulders of giants, and we are not alone.

    Humanism Deserves a Culture Worth Experiencing
    <br><br>
    It deserves art that makes us ache at the universe’s beauty, connects us to our community, and inspires us to work towards a better future. Humanism deserves a culture that can compete with the gravitas of religions that have a thousand years of tradition.
    <br><br>
    We can create a community that is worth participating in, not because you stop believing in God and don’t have anywhere else to go, but because that community can transform your life in positive, powerful ways.
    <br><br>
    Help create a culture to be proud of.
